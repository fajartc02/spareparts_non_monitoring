        <h1>Global Access Provisions</h1>
          <p>
            Definitions:
            “Developed Country” means any country other than a Developing Country.
            “Developing Country” means any country identified as Low-income or Lower-middleincome in the World Bank “Country and Lending Groups” classification, or any country listed
            as eligible to receive support from the GAVI Alliance (formerly known as the Global Alliance
            for Vaccines and Immunisation), as such list may be updated from to time by the GAVI Alliance.
            “Humanitarian Purposes” means practice of Patent Rights in the prevention or
            treatment of disease in humans by or on behalf of any Qualified Humanitarian Organization
            (including, for clarity, practice of Patent Rights by contractors, manufactures or distributors
            acting for or on behalf of such Qualified Humanitarian Organizations on a fee-for-service, feefor-product or charitable basis) (a) to manufacture Licensed Products anywhere in the world for
            the sole and express purposes of distribution and use of such Licensed Products in one or more
            Developing Countries, and (b) to sell or otherwise distribute Licensed Products for use solely in
            one or more Developing Countries; provided, however, that sales and distribution of Licensed
            Products shall not be deemed made for Humanitarian Purposes unless products are distributed at
            locally-affordable prices.
            “Qualified Humanitarian Organization” means any governmental agency, nongovernmental agency or other not-for-profit organization that has as one of its bona fide missions
            to address the public health needs of underserved populations on a not-for-profit basis. For
            clarity, Qualified Humanitarian Organizations do not include non-governmental agencies and
            non-for-profit organizations that are formed or established for the benefit of any for-profit entity.
            Provisions:
            A. Retained Rights. [Note: additional retained rights language may be added to allow Harvard
            to grant licenses in the Patent Rights to non-profits for purposes of alleviating unmet health
            needs of local populations in Developing Countries.]
            “Harvard retains the right to grant non-exclusive licenses to practice the Patent Rights
            and to use the Harvard Technology Transfer Materials, in each case solely to Qualified
            Humanitarian Organizations and solely for Humanitarian Purposes; provided that:
            (1) Any such license shall expressly exclude the right to export any Licensed Product
            from any Developing Country into any Developed Country or to use the Licensed
            Product in any Developed Country;
            (2) Any such license shall be on terms and conditions otherwise in compliance with and
            not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;
            (3) Any such license shall be granted only pursuant to a written agreement; and
            (4) Such licensee shall not have the right to sublicense or to assign such license to any
            person or entity; provided, however, that (1) upon the express prior written consent of
            Harvard, such licensee may sublicense or assign such license only to another
            Qualified Humanitarian Organization; and (2) that such licensee shall be entitled to
            engage independent Third Parties to practice the Patent Rights on behalf of such
            licensee solely as set forth in the definition of Humanitarian Purposes without
            Harvard’s consent.”
            B. Developing Countries. [Note: additional language may be added as a proviso to the license
            grant language or as an addition to the retained rights clause, to allow third parties to
            manufacture Licensed Products and distribute such Licensed Products in Developing
            Countries on an affordable basis.]
            “At any time beginning ___ (_) years after marketing approval of any Licensed Product
            in a first country, Harvard shall have the right to grant Third Parties licenses under the Patent
            Rights to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, import, have imported, offer for sale,
            sell, have sold or otherwise distribute or have distributed such Licensed Product or equivalent
            thereof (e.g., a generic product), in each case solely for sale or other distribution of Licensed
            Products or equivalents on a locally-affordable basis in any Developing Country(ies) in
            which such Licensed Product is not then available on a locally-affordable basis, and not for
            sale in any Developed Country.”
            C. Royalties: [Note: additional language may be added to the royalties provision, in the
            following manner, to take account of Harvard’s global initiative to make products derived
            from Harvard technologies that can improve public health accessible and affordable in
            Developing Countries.]
            “With respect to Net Sales attributable to Licensed Products sold in any Developing
            Country(ies), solely for use in such Developing Country(ies) and not for further sale or use in 
            any Developed Country(ies), Licensee and Harvard will negotiate in good faith on a country-bycountry basis a royalty percentage for such Developing Country(ies), which percentage will
            generally be in the range of zero percent (0%) to <code>smaller than percentage otherwise</code> percent (#%), keeping in mind anticipated and actual profits in such countries, as well as
            the degree to which Licensed Products are available on a locally-affordable basis on a
            Developing-Country-by-Developing-Country basis.”
            D. Patent Control. [Note: additional language may be added to the patent prosecution
            provision, to allow Harvard to retain full control of patent prosecution and enforcement in
            Developing Countries, as follows:]
            “In particular, and without intending to limit any of Harvard’s rights pursuant to this
            Agreement, Harvard expressly reserves the right to decline Licensee’s request to file,
            prosecute, maintain or defend any of the Patent Rights in any Developing Country(ies) unless
            (i) Licensee demonstrates to Harvard’s reasonable satisfaction that the filing, prosecution,
            maintenance or defense of such Patent Rights in such Developing Country(ies) would
            materially increase the locally-affordable availability of Licensed Products or equivalents
            thereof (e.g., generic products) in those and/or other Developing Country(ies) and (ii) the
            provisions of Section [__ - Enforcement] notwithstanding, Licensee agrees that Harvard shall
            hold final decision-making authority, on a case-by-case basis, as to whether Licensee will be
            permitted to enforce such Patent Rights in such Developing Country(ies).”
